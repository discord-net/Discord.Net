# Voice binaries

These binaries were taken from the [DSharpPlus](https://dsharpplus.github.io/natives/index.html) website and are temporary until we resolve the old url for them.

**NOTE**: You need to rename libopus.dll to opus.dll before use, otherwise audio client will complain about missing libraries.
