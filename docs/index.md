## What is Discord.Net?

Discord.Net is an asynchronous, multi-platform .NET Library used to
interface with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/).

## Where to begin?

If this is your first time using Discord.Net, you should refer to the
[Intro](xref:Guides.Introduction) for tutorials.

More experienced users might want to refer to the
[API Documentation](xref:API.Docs) for a breakdown of the individual
objects in the library.
