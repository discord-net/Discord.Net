## What is Discord.NET?

Discord.Net is an unofficial asynchronous, multi-platform .NET library used to
interface with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/).

## Where to begin?

If this is your first time using Discord.Net, you should refer to the
[Intro](xref:Guides.Introduction) for tutorials.

If you're coming from Discord.Net V2, you should refer to the [V2 -> V3](xref:Guides.V2V3Guide) guides.

More experienced users might want to refer to the
[API Documentation](xref:API.Docs) for a breakdown of the individual
objects in the library.

## Nightlies

Nightlies are builds of Discord.NET that are still in an experimental phase, and have not been released.  
They are available through 2 different sources:
- [BaGet](https://baget.discordnet.dev/)
- [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/discord-net/packages?repo_name=Discord.Net)

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Packages requires authentication. You can find more information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).
