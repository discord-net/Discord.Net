# Installing Discord.NET Labs

Discord.NET Labs is the experimental repository that introduces new features & chips away at all bugs until ready for merging into Discord.NET.
Are you looking to test or play with new features?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is very ill advised to use Discord.NET Labs in a production environment normally,
> considering it can include bugs that have not been discovered yet, as features are freshly added.
> However if approached correctly, will work as a pre-release to Discord.NET.
> Make sure to report any bugs at the Labs [repository] or on [Discord]
