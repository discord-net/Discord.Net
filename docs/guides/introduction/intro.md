# Introduction

## Looking to get started?

Welcome! Before you dive into this library, however, you should have
some decent understanding of the language
you are about to use. This library touches on
[Task-based Asynchronous Pattern] \(TAP), [polymorphism], [interface]
and many more advanced topics extensively. Please make sure that you
understand these topics to some extent before proceeding. With all
that being said, feel free to visit us on Discord at the link below
if you have any questions!

An official collection of samples can be found
in [our GitHub repository].

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that you should *not* try to blindly copy paste
> the code. The examples are meant to be a template or a guide.
