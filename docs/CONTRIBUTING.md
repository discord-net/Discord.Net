# Contributing to Docs

We don't really have any strict conditions for writing documentation,
but just keep these few guidelines in mind:

* Keep code samples in the `guides/samples` folder
* When referencing an object in the API, link to it's page in the
 API documentation.
* Documentation should be written in clear and proper English*

\* If anyone is interested in translating documentation into other
languages, please open an issue or contact me on
Discord (`foxbot#0282`).

## Layout

Documentation should be written in a FAQ/Wiki style format.

Recommended reads:

* http://docs.microsoft.com
* http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/

Style consistencies:

* Use a ruler set at 70 characters
* Links should use long syntax
* Pages should be short and concise, not broad and long

Example of long link syntax:

```
