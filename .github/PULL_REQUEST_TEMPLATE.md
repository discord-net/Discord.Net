Thanks in advance for your contribution to Discord.Net!

Before opening a pull request, please consider the following:

Does your changeset adhere to the Contributing Guidelines?

Does your changeset address a specific issue or idea? If not, please
break your changes up into multiple requests.

Have your changes been previously discussed with other members
of the community? We prefer new features to be vetted through
an issue or a discussion in our Discord channel first; bug-fixes
and other small changes are generally fine without prior vetting.

Please remove this section, and include a summary of your changes
below.
