      label: Check your intents
      description: If your issue is related to not recieving expected events you may have setup your gateway intents incorectly. 
                    Newer versions of Discord.Net use a more modern versions of Discords API that requires you tell it what events
                    you want to recieve. Discord.Net defaults to all non-privleged intents, but if your bot requires privleged intents 
                    you need specify them in your clients config. You can see what intents you need for your events 
                    [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#list-of-intents)
