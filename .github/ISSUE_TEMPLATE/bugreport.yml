      description: If your issue is related to an exception make sure the error was thrown by Discord.Net, and not your code or another library. 
                  If you get an `HttpException` with the error code `401`, then the error is caused by your bot's permissions, not dnet. 
                  If you have a issue that does directly relate to an API bug, feel free to open a [Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net/discussions)

      label: Check your intents
      description: If your issue is related to not receiving expected events, you may have setup your gateway intents incorrectly. 
                    Newer versions of Discord.Net use a more modern version of Discord's API that requires you tell it what events
                    you want to receive. Discord.Net defaults to all non-privleged intents, but if your bot requires privileged intents 
                    you need specify them in your clients config. You can see what intents you need for your events 
                    [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#list-of-intents).
